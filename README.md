<img src="/docs/img/polaris_sim.jpg" align="right" height="168" >

This repository constains a vehicle simulator for use in Gazebo. The simulator is based on [drcsim](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/drcsim) developed by OSRF. Drcsim focused on the simulation of Boston Dynamics Atlas robot for the DARPA Robotics Challenge and the vehicle simulation is only a small part of the package for the vehicle task. This project tries to reuse this part of code. The goal is to create a complete simulation package for research on autonomous vehicles.
